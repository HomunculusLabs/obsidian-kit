# Project Constitution

## Project Vision
This project aims to create [PROJECT_VISION_PLACEHOLDER - replace with specific project goals]

## Core Principles

### 1. Specification-Driven Development
- All features begin with clear specifications
- Specifications are living documents that evolve
- Implementation follows documented specs

### 2. AI-Assisted Workflow
- Single AI agent manages project coordination
- Agent handles routine documentation tasks
- Human focus on creative and strategic decisions

### 3. Knowledge-Centric Approach
- Documentation is a first-class citizen
- Source materials inform all decisions
- Knowledge is captured and organized systematically

### 4. Task-Driven Execution
- Work is broken into manageable tasks
- Task completion drives project progress
- Clear dependencies and priorities

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear project specifications maintained
- [ ] Regular task completion and progress tracking
- [ ] Up-to-date documentation at all times
- [ ] Effective AI agent integration

## Decision Framework
1. **Alignment**: Does this align with project vision?
2. **Specification**: Is this properly specified?
3. **Documentation**: Will this be properly documented?
4. **Sustainability**: Can this be maintained long-term?

## Quality Standards
- All code changes require documentation updates
- Specifications must be reviewed before implementation
- Task completion includes verification steps
- Knowledge artifacts are linked and discoverable
